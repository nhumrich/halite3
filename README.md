# Halite Bot

This is my halite bot.
Most of the logic is in a single file: MyBot.py

some of it lurks in hlt.globals or hlt.entity.ship

everything else is junk created in the process of doing things.

I wrote some gym code that runs my bot against itself for finding ideal values per map size, and those values are in constants.
